## Project Overview
The project examines historical aircraft incidents to identify safety trends and propose improvements. It analyzes factors like aircraft models, engines, injuries, and weather to assist fleet managers in making informed choices about aircraft selection and operations. It compares amateur-built and professional aircraft, highlighting their respective risks. The aim is to enhance aviation safety through data-driven insights and recommendations.

## Data

The dataset includes key fields that represent critical aspects of aircraft incidents. Each column has been cleaned and prepared for analysis to ensure accurate results.

## Results

Through analyzing these datasets, several key findings were uncovered:

- **High-risk models**: Certain models, such as the Cessna 152 and Boeing 737, have shown a higher incidence rate in the dataset. These models may require closer scrutiny or enhanced safety measures to mitigate risks.
- **Geographic Distribution**: Hotspots for aviation accidents have been identified, suggesting areas that may require enhanced safety measures or operational scrutiny.
-  **Recommended models**: Safer models, including the Cessna C208B and C207, consistently performed better in terms of safety metrics. These models are recommended for operators seeking safer fleet options.
  
- **Safer engine types**: Turbo Prop and Turbo Shaft engines were identified as more reliable in terms of safety performance when compared to other engine types. Operators are encouraged to consider these engines for better safety outcomes.

- **Weather impact**: Incidents that occurred under IMC conditions showed a higher rate of fatalities. This finding underscores the need for improved pilot training and better preparation for flights in challenging weather conditions.

- ## Recommendations
- Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are provided to improve aircraft safety and fleet management:
 -**Aircraft Selection:**
   - Prioritize purchasing aircraft models with lower accident rates and fewer fatalities. Focus on models that have demonstrated better safety records in the analysis.

 -**Pilot Training Programs:**
   - Implement comprehensive training programs that address the specific risks associated with identified weather conditions and high-risk aircraft types.

 -**Safety Protocols:**
    
   - By developing and enforcing strict safety protocols, especially for operations in regions identified as accident hotspots

   - ## Visualizations

To help communicate the findings and recommendations effectively, the following visual resources are available:
